## Food Recommendation System Using Machine Learning for Diabetic Patients in Sri Lanka

### Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to recommend proper foods for Sri Lankan diabetic patients in the context of nutrition and food characteristics by developing a machine learning based intelligent mobile application.

### Background

Sri Lanka being a lower middle income developing country lacks adequate resources, both financial and human, to manage the increasing load of diabetic patients. Furthermore, according to the research, one in five adults in Sri Lanka has either pre-diabetes or diabetes and one-third of those with diabetes are undiagnosed. Diabetes is mainly a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism and maintaining the best carbohydrate to lipid ratio in the diet is a major challenge. Hence nutrition plays a significant role in controlling diabetes.

The [Food Composition Table](http://bfnvw.bfnsrilanka.org/foodcomp/) dataset will be divided based on the nutrients for diabetes, with the help of a nutritionist. The clustering algorithms are used to find foods with an approximate amount of nutrients. In the end, the system will be evaluated by invited nutritionists.

### Expected Outcomes

- Suggest whether a particular food is healthy or not for diabetic patients
- Train a machine learning model to suggest foods with an approximate amount of nutritional values (specifically for unhealthy foods)
- Predict whether a newly introduced food is suitable for diabetic patients and if the food is not suitable, suggest healthy foods with an approximate amount of nutritional values
- Develop a user friendly interface to access the recommendation system
